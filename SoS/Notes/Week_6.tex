	\mysection{1}{Modern Encryption Methods}
		As advanced and difficult to solve asymmetric cryptosystems are, they are also very computation intensive for encryption/decryption and thus too slow for the modern communication speeds. Hence we compromise and settle for a relatively secure but much faster encryption algorithm. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We share the key using an asymmetric cipher (like the RSA).
			\item Further communication is done by some ad-hoc but algorithmic and reversible mixing of the message bits the way the key governs.
		\end{itemize}
