		\subsection{Basics}
			Well the basics are luckily... pretty basic. All of the stuff we learnt already in JEE. Some of the interesting concepts are in the next few sections.

		\subsection{Monty Hall Problem}
		\begin{greenbox}
			\centering \emph{Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? } \par
		\end{greenbox}

			\raggedright One important thing to keep in mind which makes the final solution seem non-intuitive \(\rightarrow\) The host knows which door has the Car behind it. He will never open the door with the car.
			Let us try to rationalise the problem based on Bayes' Theorem.\\
			Assume for now that whatever door we choose is called $Door_1$, the host opens either $Door_2$ or $Door_3$ \par

			Case 1: $Car \rightarrow Door_1$\\
			\quad In that case $P(keep\rightarrow Car)=1$ and $P(swap\rightarrow Car)=0$

			Case 2: $Car \rightarrow Door_2$\\
			\quad In that case $P(keep\rightarrow Car)=0$ and $P(swap\rightarrow Car)=1$

			Case 3: $Car \rightarrow Door_3$\\
			\quad In that case $P(keep\rightarrow Car)=0$ and $P(swap\rightarrow Car)=1$\par 

			Using Total probability theorem, it is obvious that $P(keep \rightarrow Car)= \frac{1}{3}$ and $P(swap \rightarrow Car)= \frac{2}{3}$
